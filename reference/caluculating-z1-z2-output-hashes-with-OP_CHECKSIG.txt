Niles - I really enjoyed your article on

Recovering Bitcoin private keys using weak signatures from the blockchain

I have read and researched it a bit, and there was one point that I was a little unclear on and was hoping that you could clarify. 

We just need to find z1 and z2! These are the hashes of the outputs to be signed. Letâ€™s fetch the output transations and calculate them (it is calculated by OP_CHECKSIG):

z1: c0e2d0a89a348de88fda08211c70d1d7e52ccef2eb9459911bf977d587784c6e
z2: 17b0f41c8c337ac1e18c98759e83a8cccbc368dd9d89e5f03cb633c265fd0ddc


Do you have any hints on how that step was done.

That step depends on the transaction type. Usually, you fetch the
previous output, insert the script, zero out all other output scripts
and hash it. I'd suggest looking at the bitcoin source code to see how
exactly it is calculated in detail.
